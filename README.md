Background:

Your mission for level 1 is to kill 10 enemy spacecraft. Each enemy shot will remove 1 health. Each enemy destroyed will give you one health. Colliding with an enemy will destroy it, remove 1 health, and give you no points. Enemy fire is also able to deflect your shots. There are bumpers on the edge of the screen, however if you try hard enough you will be allowed to fly through them. This will result in your death. This level you have 10 health.

The mission for level 2 is to kill 15 enemy spacecraft while avoiding the asteroids. The enemy will be much more varied in size and movement. The asteroids will damage your health proportional to their size. Each asteroid will have to be damaged to a minimum size to be destroyed. Destroying an asteroid will also give you 1 point. This level you have 50 health.
